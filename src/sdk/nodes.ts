   * Create node
   *
   * @remarks
   * This endpoint allows nodes to register or update their public address in the system.
   * When a node comes online or changes its address, it can use this endpoint to ensure
   * the system has its current address for routing requests.
   *
   * ## Errors
   *
   * Returns various `AtomaProxyError` variants:
   * * `MissingHeader` - If the signature header is missing
   * * `InvalidHeader` - If the signature header is malformed
   * * `InvalidBody` - If:
   *   - The request body cannot be read
   *   - The signature is invalid
   *   - The body cannot be parsed
   *   - The sui address doesn't match the signature
   * * `InternalError` - If:
   *   - The state manager channel is closed
   *   - The registration event cannot be sent
   *   - Node Sui address lookup fails

  /**
   * Create a node lock for confidential compute
   *
   * @remarks
   * This endpoint attempts to find a suitable node and retrieve its public key for encryption
   * through a two-step process:
   *
   * 1. First, it tries to select an existing node with a public key directly.
   * 2. If no node is immediately available, it falls back to finding the cheapest compatible node
   *    and acquiring a new stack entry for it.
   *
   * This endpoint is specifically designed for confidential compute scenarios where
   * requests need to be encrypted before being processed by nodes.
   *
   * ## Errors
   *   - `INTERNAL_SERVER_ERROR` - Communication errors or missing node public keys
   *   - `SERVICE_UNAVAILABLE` - No nodes available for confidential compute
